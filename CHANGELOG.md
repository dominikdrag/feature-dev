# Changelog

## [1.1.8] - 2026-01-05

### Changed
- Agent outputs in key decision phases must now be presented in full (not summarized)
  - Phase 4 (Architecture Design): Full architect proposals for informed selection
  - Phase 6 (Testing): Full test-analyzer output for strategy approval
  - Phase 7 (Quality Review): Full reviewer findings for issue selection
  - Ensures maximum user control at critical workflow gates

## [1.1.7] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- PreCompact hook schema validation error
  - Added missing `hooks` array wrapper in hooks.json
  - Aligns PreCompact structure with PreToolUse hook format

## [1.1.6] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Auto-approval hook for state file operations (Write, Edit, Delete)
  - State file modifications no longer require user permission
  - Enables seamless workflow state persistence during compaction
  - Positioned first in PreToolUse hook chain to intercept early

## [1.1.5] - 2026-01-01

### Changed
- Phase 7 (Quality Review) now requires explicit user approval before applying fixes
  - Waits for ALL review agents to complete before proceeding
  - Consolidates and deduplicates findings, organized by severity
  - Presents findings summary to user with file:line and confidence scores
  - Uses `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true` for per-issue selection
  - Applies only the fixes user explicitly selected
  - Asks user if they want to re-run review after fixes are applied

## [1.1.4] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- Workflow state persistence for compaction recovery
  - State file (`.claude/feature-dev-state.json`) tracks current phase, completed phases, and key decisions
  - `PreCompact` hook automatically saves state before conversation compaction
  - Workflow resumes from correct phase after compaction or session interruption
  - State file cleaned up on Phase 8 completion

## [1.1.3] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- Phase 2 now enforces waiting for ALL exploration agents before proceeding to Phase 3
  - Added explicit blocking requirement similar to Phase 4's architecture approval gate
  - Ensures clarifying questions are informed by complete codebase exploration results

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- `test-runner` agent (Haiku) for executing tests and reporting results
  - Runs specified tests and provides structured summary
  - Reports passed, failed, skipped tests with details
  - Does not fix failures - only executes and reports

### Changed
- Phase 5 (Implementation) now validates existing tests after implementation
  - Runs `test-runner` agent to check related tests still pass
  - Fixes implementation issues before proceeding to testing phase
- Phase 6 (Testing) now uses `test-runner` agent for test execution
  - Replaces direct test running with structured agent-based execution
  - Provides clearer feedback on test failures

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-01

### Changed
- Testing phase now requires explicit user approval before writing tests
  - Test analysis results presented to user with summary of categories and cases
  - User must confirm via `AskUserQuestion` (proceed, modify scope, or skip)
  - Mirrors architecture approval pattern from Phase 4
- Upgraded `test-analyzer` agent from Sonnet to Opus for higher quality analysis

## [1.0.6] - 2025-12-30

### Changed
- `code-architect` agent now reads CLAUDE.md and style guides for project rules
  - Ensures architectures align with documented project conventions
  - Matches behavior already present in `code-reviewer` agent

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-30

### Added
- `test-analyzer` agent (Sonnet) for proposing comprehensive test plans
  - Analyzes implemented code and project test patterns
  - Proposes specific test cases with priorities
  - Identifies mocking requirements and setup complexity

### Changed
- Testing phase now uses hybrid approach:
  - `test-analyzer` agent proposes what should be tested
  - Tests written directly by Claude to preserve implementation context
  - Results in better test coverage than either approach alone

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-30

### Changed
- Testing phase no longer uses a separate `test-writer` subagent
  - Tests are now written directly by Claude to preserve local implementation context
  - Enables better understanding of what was built and how to test it

### Removed
- `test-writer` agent (functionality moved inline to main workflow)

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-30

### Changed
- Architecture variations are now surfaced when proposals converge
  - Distinguishes three scenarios: divergent, converged with variations, fully converged
  - Minor variations (naming, patterns, error handling) presented as sub-options
  - User can choose between variation points via `AskUserQuestion`

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- Architecture approval gate now works reliably
  - Phase 4 presents all distinct architecture proposals instead of auto-synthesizing
  - Uses `AskUserQuestion` for explicit user selection
  - Users can choose from proposed architectures or provide custom approach
  - Updated hook prompt to detect explicit selection responses

### Changed
- Updated README to reflect new architecture selection workflow

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- `test-writer` agent (Opus) for comprehensive test generation
- `security-auditor` agent (Sonnet) for optional security analysis
- 8-phase workflow (added Testing and Quality Review phases)
- Workflow enforcement hooks for architecture approval gate

### Changed
- Expanded workflow from basic phases to full 8-phase process

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- Initial plugin release
- `code-explorer` agent (Sonnet) for codebase analysis
- `code-architect` agent (Opus) for architecture design
- `code-reviewer` agent (Opus) for code review
- `/feature-dev` command for guided feature development
- Acknowledgement linking to Anthropic's official feature-dev plugin
