# Changelog

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-11

### Changed
- Renamed state files for consistency:
  - `devflow-state.json` → `devflow-feature-state.json` (for `/feature`)
  - `tdd-state.json` → `devflow-tdd-state.json` (for `/tdd`)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **`/tdd` command** - New 9-phase Test-Driven Development workflow with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
  - Test-first approach: tests are designed BEFORE architecture (Phase 4 before Phase 5)
  - `tdd-test-planner` agent (Opus) designs tests from requirements before code exists
  - Per-task Red-Green-Refactor implementation cycles:
    - **RED**: Write failing test, verify it fails
    - **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass (max 3 retries)
    - **REFACTOR**: Optional cleanup while keeping tests green
  - Separate state files (`devflow-tdd-state.json`, `tdd-plan.md`) from `/feature` workflow
  - TDD-specific task structure with `TDD-NNN` tasks and substeps (`TDD-NNN-RED`, `TDD-NNN-GREEN`, `TDD-NNN-REFACTOR`)
  - Configurable agent counts: `--explorers`, `--planners`, `--architects`, `--reviewers`

## [2.1.8] - 2026-01-09

### Changed
- Out-of-range agent count flags now clamp to valid range instead of using defaults
  - e.g., `--explorers=15` now uses 10 (max) instead of 3 (default)
