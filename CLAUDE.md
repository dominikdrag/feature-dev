# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a Claude Code plugin that provides an 8-phase feature development workflow. It uses specialized agents for codebase exploration, architecture design, testing, security auditing, and code review.

## Plugin Structure

```

## Agent Configuration

Agents are defined in markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When-to-use description for auto-triggering
tools: Glob, Grep, LS, Read, ...  # Allowed tools
model: sonnet|opus                 # Model to use
color: yellow|green|red           # Status line color
---
[System prompt content]
```

## Hook System

The plugin uses a `PreToolUse` hook on `Write|Edit` operations to enforce the architecture approval gate. The prompt-based hook checks that the user has explicitly selected an architecture via `AskUserQuestion` before allowing implementation.

If the prompt-based approach proves unreliable, NOTES.md documents an alternative state-file approach using `.claude/feature-dev-approved.tmp`.

## Workflow Phases

1. Discovery - Understand requirements
2. Codebase Exploration - Launch 3 parallel `code-explorer` agents
3. Clarifying Questions - Resolve ambiguities
4. Architecture Design - Launch 3 `code-architect` agents, present options via `AskUserQuestion`
5. Implementation - Build after user selects architecture
6. Testing - Launch `test-writer` agent
7. Quality Review - Launch 3 parallel `code-reviewer` agents (+ optional `security-auditor`)
8. Summary - Document completion

## Key Design Decisions

- Opus models used for architecture, testing, and code review (higher reasoning quality)
- Sonnet used for exploration and security auditing (cost efficiency for analysis tasks)
- Confidence thresholds: code-reviewer >= 80/100, security-auditor >= 85/100
- Architecture selection is a hard gate - implementation blocked until user explicitly chooses
